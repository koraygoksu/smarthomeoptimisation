Optimisation project made by me and Oğuzhan Yazıcı using GAMS, SolarPy, Excel etc.

Main objective of this project is minimizing cost of electricity bill. We used real pricing datas as triple-tariff and imported real-time sun radiation datas using solarPy.

We've used GAMS 1.7.3 and CPLEX as solver in order to optimize smart household's energy cost.
We modeled four different houses using other energy management and producing technologies like:
- Simple House
- House with only Energy Storage System
- House with only Renewable Energy System
- House with both ESS and RES

After optimizing all this scenarios and compare them we've seen the importance of ESS and RES and their contribution to household's economy. Based on this project we've seen that ESS and RES integrated houses are saves up to %58 on electricity bill.

This project is supervised by Res. Asst. Tayfur GÖKÇEK
